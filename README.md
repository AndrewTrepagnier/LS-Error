# LS-Error

Regression is a major topic of interest in Machine Learning. In this repository, I implement a regression model at varying nth order polynomials and graphically show the optimal equation fit using the LS-Error method. The premise of the regression model is heavily borrowed from "Mathematical Foundations of MAchine Learning" by my professor, Dr. Seonjia Kim. The noisy sine wave generator was a python script I built to generate the random data points.
